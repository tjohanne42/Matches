Start "bin/Matches" to start the game

The Game :

Rules :	game starts with NB_MATCHES matches
		players will take 1,2 or 3 matches at their turns.
		player who takes last matche lose
		enter 'x' to exit

NB_MATCHES is defined in "inc/matches.h"

If you want to compile again, do the rule "make re"

I made this by using a simple reinforcement learning algorithm.
